# module-4-challenge
In this challenge, I created a browser quiz from javascript, HTML and CSS elements. I used the basic format of an HTML document and I centered the text on the CSS element. In the javascript, I created a function that starts the quiz when the "Start" button is clicked and then prompts the first auestion of 5. If the correct answer has been selected, it will move onto the next question. If an incorrect answer is selected, the timer will subtract by 10 seconds and when the timer hits 0, the quiz is over or when all questions have been answered correctly, the quiz is over, and you can input your initials in a text box.
